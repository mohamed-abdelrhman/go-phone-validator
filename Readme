##Why i took this approach for creating this validator
## if i have database with data and i want to return the validated data,there is two solutions for this.

A- validate the returned data on the runtime
B-perform operations on the database then flag each record with valid or not valid then return normal git or list operations
and you would escape  N+ operations and unnecessary loops to validate the data.

I took the second approach so the app can perform better on the run time and created the regex to validate the new inputs
for example if new customer want to add his phone number he/she gonna choose there country of residence from there i am gonna get the regex and update the phone number
record with status valid or not valid

that's  why i created the full crud operations for the customers module and for the countries module

then in the end point filter
localhost:3000/customers/filter
it can take country_id or status(valid) or both or neither and it will filter the data accordingly
